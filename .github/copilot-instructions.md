This repository consists of a schema generation project under the [src](../src) directory. It also consists of generated ARM template JSON schemas under [schemas](../schemas) directory.

If you are asked to make changes to this repo, the changes should be made to the src files, and applied to the schema files by running the generation process.

Schemas can be re-generated by running the following in the repo root. This takes a minute, but is useful to assess the impact of changes that are made to the schema generation logic:
```sh
./scripts/run.sh
```

If you run into test baseline failures, they can be fixed by running the following in the repo root:
```sh
./scripts/UpdateBaselines.ps1
```

## Testing
Tests can be run by executing the following in the repo root:
```sh
dotnet test
```

Prefer FluentAssertions (`x.Should().Be(y)`) for assertions instead of MSTest assertions (`Assert.AreEqual(x, y)`).

It's a good idea to also include baselines for files where a visual inspection of the output is useful. Baselines are stored under the [src/TemplateSchemaGenerator.Tests/Files](../src/TemplateSchemaGenerator.Tests/Files) directory.
