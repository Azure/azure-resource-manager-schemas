# azure-resource-manager-schemas 

This is the repo for template deployment schemas hosted under `https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas`. Please see below for information on contributing and publishing updated schemas.

## Updating Schemas
> We only publish template schemas for resource providers that are **publicly available**. This means that there should be no restrictions (private preview, internal-only allowlisting) on who can call your APIs. As a general rule, if there is not an API definition in the [Public API Specs Repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs), we will not consider a PR.

There are two processes for updating schemas:
1. **Daily autogeneration**: Schemas are automatically generated from definitions in the [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) repo. This requires [onboarding](/generator/README.md#onboarding-teams-to-autogeneration-pipeline) on a per-provider basis.
2. **Manually**: Schemas are manually authored and committed via PR.

### Has my team been onboarded for daily autogeneration?
Please see [generator/autogenlist.ts](/generator/autogenlist.ts) for the list of teams which have been onboarded. `basePath` refers to the path in the [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) repo, and `namespace` is the Resource Provider namespace.

**If your team has been onboarded, we do not require any manual contributions to this repo and your schemas will automatically be kept up to date by the pipeline.**

## Authoring Schemas and submitting a PR
**Please ensure you have read [Updating Schemas](#updating-schemas) before continuing with this step, and only continue if this applies to your team.**

### Authoring
You can use the generator in this repo to automatically generate a schema from a swagger spec checked into the [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) repo.

#### Generating locally
1. Fork this repo, and clone it locally.
2. Run the following commands (replace the base path accordingly - valid paths can be disovered with `npm run list-basepaths`):
```bash
cd generator
npm install
npm run generate-single -- --base-path myprovider/resource-manager
```
4. Review the generator logs to ensure no errors, and review the changes generated.
5. Ensure that you have reviewed the guidelines under [Submitting a PR](#submitting-a-pr).
6. Generate a commit and push it to your fork.
7. Submit a pull request to this repo. Please include the full command output in a PR comment.

Alternatively, you can hand-author your schema, but **please note** that this process is error-prone, and ARM will not be responsible for reviewing for accuracy when validating your PR.

### Submitting a PR
* Ensure that any $refs to resource types that you are adding has been added to the following top-level template schema: [schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json](/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json)
* If your schema has been manually generated, please ensure you include appropriate tests in [tests](/tests/)
* If adding a new resource type, please add examples to the templates in [tools/templateTests](/tools/templateTests/)
* Ensure that the test suite passes (see [Tests](#tests))

> **NOTE**: We will no longer be taking any updates to the [2015-01-01](/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json) or [2014-04-01-preview](/schemas/2014-04-01-preview/deploymentTemplate.json) root schemas. If you are authoring a template which references one of these schemas, please upgrade it to use the [2019-04-01](/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json) root schema by setting the `$schema` property to `https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#"`.

### Runing Unit Tests
Use the following commands to execute the test suite locally:
```bash
cd tools
npm install
npm test
```

## Manual testing with a local schema server
This repo contains a command to run a schema web server which will host files directly from your local repo. This can be useful if you want to validate schemas against a particular tool - for example if you want to verify VSCode autocompletion and syntax highlighting. By default this will listen on port 3000, but this can be modified by editing [tools/server.ts](/tools/server.ts).
To start an instance you can use the following commands:
```bash
cd tools
npm install
npm run serve
```

Once this is running, you can create a basic template with the following structure (replacing the sections between `<` and `>` as appropriate for your scenario):
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://<hostname>:<port>/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json",
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "<providerNamespace>/<resourceType>",
      "apiVersion": "<apiVersion>",
      "properties": {
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
**NOTE** Many client tools will cache responses from schema servers, so you may need to clear this cache if you are testing modifications, or alternatively, change the port between retries.
