# azure-resource-manager-schemas 

This is the repo for template deployment schemas hosted under `https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas`. Please see below for information on contributing and publishing updated schemas.

## Submitting a PR
* Ensure that any new resource types that you are adding have been added to the following top-level template schemas:
  * [schemas\2014-04-01-preview\deploymentTemplate.json](schemas/2014-04-01-preview/deploymentTemplate.json)
  * [schemas\2015-01-01\deploymentTemplate.json](schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json)
  * [schemas\2019-04-01\deploymentTemplate.json](schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json)
* If your schema has been manually generated, please ensure you include appropriate tests in [tests](tests/)
* If adding a new resource type, please add examples to the templates in [tools/templateTests](tools/templateTests/)
* Ensure that the test suite passes (see [Tests](#tests))

## Tests
Use the following commands to execute the test suite locally:
* `cd tools`
* `npm install`
* `npm test`

## Autogenerating from swagger
You can use the generator in this repo to automatically generate a schema from a swagger spec checked into the [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) repo. We are working on fully automating this process, but please note that until then, it is your responsibility to ensure that the auto-generated schema has been correctly formatted before submitting a pull request.
