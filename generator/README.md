## Generator

### Getting started
1. Checkout this repo
2. `cd generator`
3. `npm install`

### Running commands
* `npm run clean` - cleans local modifications to the schemas directory
* `npm run list-basepaths` - lists all the valid base paths for generation
* `npm run generate-all` - re-generates all autogenerated schemas
* `npm run generate-single {basePath}` - re-generates all api versions under a given specs base path
* See [package.json](./package.json) for more commands

### Daily autogeneration

#### Autogeneration Pipeline
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azure/azure-resource-manager-schemas/_apis/build/status/Autogenerate?branchName=autogenerate)](https://dev.azure.com/azure/azure-resource-manager-schemas/_build/latest?definitionId=38&branchName=autogenerate)

View the Pipeline Configuration [here](/azure-pipelines-autogen.yml).

#### Merging Pipeline-generated schemas

1. Review the status badge on this page to ensure the latest run was successful.
2. Create a Pull Request from [`autogenerate`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-resource-manager-schemas/tree/autogenerate) to [`master`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-resource-manager-schemas/tree/master).
3. If there are any modifications to [schemas/2019-04-01/autogeneratedResources.json](/schemas/2019-04-01/autogeneratedResources.json), push a commit to the autogenerate branch to make any corresponding changes to [schemas/2014-04-01-preview/deploymentTemplate.json](/schemas/2014-04-01-preview/deploymentTemplate.json) and [schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json](/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json).

#### Onboarding teams to autogeneration pipeline

1. Run `npm run list-basepaths` to discover the specs repo path containing the swagger definitions.
2. Run `npm run generate-single {basePath}` to generate schemas for them. Save the output to file.
3. Remove all references to the provider namespace from [schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json](/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json). 
4. If there are any modifications to [schemas/2019-04-01/autogeneratedResources.json](/schemas/2019-04-01/autogeneratedResources.json), push a commit to the autogenerate branch to make any corresponding changes to [schemas/2014-04-01-preview/deploymentTemplate.json](/schemas/2014-04-01-preview/deploymentTemplate.json) and [schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json](/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json).
5. Commit all the changed files, and submit a PR to this repo with title "Onboarding {provider} for autogeneration". Include the full output saved in step 2 as a comment.
6. Ensure all CI tests pass, and ask the team to review the PR (including tool output) to ensure that all expected resources have been detected and generated as expected.
